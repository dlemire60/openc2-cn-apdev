## Statement of Purpose ##

This repository is for developing an OASIS Committee Note describing a process for 
developing OpenC2 Actuator Profiles (APs), including the use of the JSON Abstract 
Data Notation (JADN) information modeling language in the development of APs.

OpenC2 Actuator Profiles (APs) specify the subset of the OpenC2 language relevant 
in the context of specific actuator functions. A profile refines the meaning of 
language elements used to perform the actuator function, and often defines 
additional elements that are relevant and/or unique to that function. This 
Committee Note describes the TCâ€™s process for using the JSON Abstract Data Notation 
(JADN) information modeling language in the development of APs, resulting in a 
rigorous schema for an AP properly integrated with the base OpenC2 language.

## Branches 

OpenC2 work product repositories are organized a bit differently
than typical open source software project repositories:

* The **Published** (default) branch represents the current,
  stable, approved version of the work product. If the product
  hasn't progressed past an [OASIS Committee Specification Draft
  (CSD)](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26/#committeeDraft),
  this branch is essentially empty
* The **Working** branch is where all work-in-progress content is
  captured, and is the place to go for the current working
  version

More information about the TC's repository organizing conventions
and branching strategy can be found in our [Documentation
Norms](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-tc-ops/blob/main/Documentation-Norms.md#433-configure-repository).
