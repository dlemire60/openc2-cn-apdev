#### Abstract:
Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable machine-to-machine communications for purposes of command and control of cyber defense components in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation. OpenC2 Actuator Profiles (APs) specify the subset of the OpenC2 language relevant in the context of specific actuator functions. A profile refines the meaning of language elements used to perform the actuator function, and often defines additional elements that are relevant and/or unique to that function. This Committee Note describes the TCâ€™s process for using the JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN) information modeling language in the development of APs, resulting in a rigorous schema for an AP properly integrated with the base OpenC2 language.

#### Status:
This is a Non-Standards Track Work Product. The patent provisions of the OASIS IPR Policy do not apply.
