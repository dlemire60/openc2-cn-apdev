#### Abstract:
Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable machine-to-machine communications for purposes of command and control of cyber defense components in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation. OpenC2 Actuator Profiles (APs) specify the subset of the OpenC2 language relevant in the context of specific actuator functions. A profile refines the meaning of language elements used to perform the actuator function, and often defines additional elements that are relevant and/or unique to that function. This Committee Note describes the TCâ€™s process for using the JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN) information modeling language in the development of APs, resulting in a rigorous schema for an AP properly integrated with the base OpenC2 language.

# 1 Introduction

_This document is non-normative in its entirety._

## 1.1 Purpose

This OASIS Committee Note (CN) describes a process for developing
OpenC2 Actuator Profiles (APs), including the use of the JSON
Abstract Data Notation (JADN) information modeling language in
the development of APs. The process described here results in an
AP design and specification that aligns to the relevent use cases
and an associated rigorous JADN schema that binds the AP to the
OpenC2 language.

## 1.2 Glossary

<!-- Optional section with suggested subsections -->

### 1.2.1 Definitions of terms

-   **Action**: The task or activity to be performed (e.g.,
    'deny').

-   **Actuator**: The Consumer that executes the Command.

-   **Actuator Profile**: The document that defines a category of
    operations performed by an Actuator (e.g., 'Stateless Packet
    Filtering').

-   **Argument**: A property of a Command that provides
    additional information on how to perform the Command, such as
    date/time, periodicity, duration, etc.

-   **Command**: A Message defined by an Action-Target pair that
    is sent from a Producer and received by a Consumer.

-   **Consumer**: A managed device / application that receives
    Commands. Note that a single device / application can have
    both Consumer and Producer capabilities.

-   **Information Modeling**: A process to understand and
    document the essential information content relevant to a
    system, application, or protocol exchange without regard to
    how that information is represented in actual
    implementations.

-   **Message**: A content- and transport-independent set of
    elements conveyed between Consumers and Producers.

-   **Producer**: A manager application that sends Commands.

-   **Request**: A Message from a Producer to a Consumer used to
    convey a Command.

-   **Response**: A Message from a Consumer to a Producer
    acknowledging a Command or returning the requested resources
    or status to a previously received Command.

-   **Specifier**: A property or field that identifies a Target
    to some level of precision.

-   **Target**: The object of the Action, i.e., the Action is
    performed on the Target (e.g., IP Address).

## 1.3 Background

This section provides background information on OpenC2, JADN, and
the role of actuator profiles (APs) to provide a context for the
process described in sections 2 and 3.

### 1.3.1 Open Command and Control (OpenC2)

OpenC2 is a suite of specifications that enables command and
control of cyber defense systems and components. OpenC2 typically
uses a request-response paradigm where a _Command_ is encoded by
a _Producer_ (managing application) and transferred to a
_Consumer_ (managed device or virtualized function) using a
secure transfer protocol, and the Consumer can respond with
status and any requested information. This request / response
paradigm is illustrated in Figure 1-1.

##### Figure 1-1: OpenC2 Request / Response Paradigm
![Figure 1-1: OpenC2 Request / Response Paradigm](images/MessageFlow.png)

OpenC2 allows the application producing the commands to discover
the set of capabilities supported by the managed devices (i.e.,
an introspection capability). This capability permits the
managing application to adjust its behavior to take advantage of
the features exposed by the managed device. The capability
definitions can be easily extended in a noncentralized manner,
allowing standard and non-standard capabilities to be defined
with semantic and syntactic rigor.

OpenC2's approach to automating cybersecurity command and control is described
in the *OpenC2 Architecture Specification*
[[OpenC2-Arch-v1.0](#openc2-arch-v10)]. The specifics of the OpenC2 language are
defined in the *OpenC2 Language Specification* [[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0](#openc2-lang-v10)].

### 1.3.2 JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN)

JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN) is a UML-based information modeling language
that defines data structure independently of data format. Information models are
used to define and generate physical data models, validate information
instances, and enable lossless translation across data formats. A JADN
specification consists of two parts: type definitions that comprise the
information model, and serialization rules that define how information instances
are represented as data. The information model is itself an information instance
that can be serialized and transferred between applications. The model is
documented using a compact and expressive interface definition language,
property tables, or entity relationship diagrams, easing integration with
existing design processes and architecture tools.

The OpenC2 TC has published a *JADN Specification*  [[JADN-v1.0](#jadn-v10)],
and a companion CN describing the use of JADN in Information Modeling (IM)
[[IM-JADN-v1.0](#im-jadn-v10)].

### 1.3.3 OpenC2 Actuator Profiles

As described in the *OpenC2 Architecture Specification*, APs
serve the purpose of scoping the general purpose OpenC2 language
to the C2 of a particular cyberdefense function:  

> OpenC2 Actuator Profiles specify the subset of the OpenC2
> language relevant in the context of specific actuator
> functions. Cyber defense components, devices, systems and/or
> instances may (in fact are likely to) implement multiple
> profiles. A profile refines the meaning of language elements
> (actions, targets, command arguments, results) used to perform
> the actuator function, and often defines additional elements
> that are relevant and/or unique to that function.

The goal of this CN is to document a well-formed approach to
developing APs that takes advantage of the rigor provided by
applying JADN information modeling to the process.

# 2 AP Development Process Overview

This section describes the standard structure of an OpenC2 AP and provides an
overview of the development process that will be detailed in 
[Section 3](#3-ap-development-process-walkthrough).

## 2.1 AP Specification Structure

OpenC2 APs employ a common structure to ensure consistent inclusion of the
essential content.  As APs are published as OASIS Specifications, the structure
also incorporates standard document elements defined by OASIS. As specified in
the *OpenC2 Language Specification*, an AP *may* extend the OpenC2 language by
defining extension targets, arguments, and specifiers needed to support the
function the AP is addressing, but *may not* define actions beyond those
contained in the LS.

The focus of the process described in this CN is to identify and refine the
specific actions, targets, arguments, specifiers, and supporting data types
needed for the AP, to illustrate their use with example message content, and to
formally define that in a schema using the JADN information modeling language.

 * Body
   * 1: Introduction (including Glossary, Acronyms and Abbreviation, Overview,
     Purpose and Scope)
   * 2: OpenC2 Language Binding 
     * 2.1: OpenC2 Command Components
       * 2.1.1: Actions -- identifies the actions relevant for this AP
       * 2.1.2: Targets -- identifies the targets relevant for this AP,
         including extension targets
       * 2.1.3: Type Definitions -- identifies extension types relevant for this
         AP targets
       * 2.1.4: Command Arguments
       * 2.1.5: Actuator Specifiers
     * 2.2: OpenC2 Response Components
     * 2.3: OpenC2 Commands -- defines the valid Action / Target pairs for this AP
       * 2.3.x -- describes each valid command and the expected behavior
   * 3: Conformance -- defines requirements for claiming conformance to this AP
 * Annex A: JADN Schema -- identifies the JADN schema files defining the
   normative schema for this AP. The schema file(s) are normative, per OASIS
   conventions, and take precedence over the text in the AP specification. The
   schema(s) are linked in an _Annex_ to support potential adoption of the AP as
   an ITO-T Recommendation (Annexes are normative in ITU-T Recommendations,
   Appendices are non-normative).
 * Appendices
   * Appendix A: References
   * Appendix B: Safety, Security, and Privacy Considerations
   * Appendix C: Acknowledgements
   * Appendix D: Revision History
   * Appendix E: Message Examples
   * Appendix F: Notices
 * Associated schema files (packaged separately, linked from Annex A)


## 2.2 Process Steps

Figure 2-1 illustrates a process for the development of an Actuator Profile (AP)
based on defining use cases, prototopying messages, and formalizing that
material in a JADN information model. The process assumes a degree of iteration
toward completion and its execution does not need to be strictly linear.

> Note: inital draft graphic, to be refined as document develops

##### **Figure 2-1:  Actuator Profile Development Process**
![Figure 2-1: AP Development Process](images/CN-AP-Dev-Overview.drawio.png)

 1. **AP Development Initiation:** Identify the need, define the scope, receive
    TC approval, request a starter document, establish a work environment.
 2. **Develop AP Content:** a development loop for creating the AP,
 
    A) **Develop Use Cases:** Identify use case(s) for control of cyber defense
       function for the AP.

    B) **Develop Example Messages:** Develop example messages to implement the
       defined use case(s), and capture in the Examples appendix.
    
    C) **Develop JADN Schema:** Develop the JADN information model specifying
       the types needed to create and validate the example messages.
    
    D) **Link JADN Schema:**  Link to the JADN schema file(s) from Annex A.

    E) **Create Property Tables:** Use JADN tooling to generate property tables
       from the JADN schema.

    F) **Insert Property Tables and Associated Text:** Add the property tables
       for the schema to the body of the AP specification, and develop
       corresponding text content.
 3. **Interate To Completion:** As the AP matures the initial use case(s) can be
    refined and additional use cases can be defined and integrated as described
    in Step 2.
 4.  **Develop Final Example Messages from JADN Schema:** The example message
     content included in the AP should be finalized based on the JADN schema to
     ensure the messages are valid and conform to the schema.
 5.  **Define Conformance Requirements:** All OASIS specifications are required
     to include [conformance requirements](https://docs.oasis-open.org/templates/TCHandbook/ConformanceGuidelines.html). 
 6.  **Review, Approval, and Publication:** All OASIS specifications are
     required to follow the standard approval process, including [public
     review](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26/#publicReview)
     prior to [final TC
     approval](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26/#committeeSpec).
